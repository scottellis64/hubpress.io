Yesterday I met with Isaac to talk about my future with the OpenPages group.  I made it clear to him the day before that I was unhappy, and recounted to him the promises that Chris Su had made to me to woo me into accepting full-time employment with IBM.  Among these points were:

    - As we went along, Chris told me that I needed to work harder at getting buy in from my co-workers
    - More later...
