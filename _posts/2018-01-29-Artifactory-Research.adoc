*Steps Taken*

- Created a request to create a new local Artifactory repository for a Docker registry.  This created a https://github.ibm.com/Cloud-DevOps-Transformation-Services/artifactory-repositories/pull/1459[pull request].
- Once authenticated, cloned that entire Github repo locally.  This repo contains all registrations, and will take some time to understand.  The OpenPages registration for Docker is there.
- I am instructed to create an API Key and use that as a password for all access to administrative access.  The internal artifactory page page is https://na-blue.artifactory.swg-devops.com[here].
- The explanation of how to acquire an API is described https://pages.github.ibm.com/TAAS/tools_guide/artifactory/authentication-and-authorization.html[here].  
	- From the home page, click on my email address and I am navigated to the User Profile page, where I enter my intranet password and click the Unlock button.  
    - From here I can now generate an API key, which I have done.  I can then click on an icon to view the API key, and there is an icon to copy the API key.  
    - After creating the API key, on the command line I am able to perform a docker login using the api key as my password using the same user name, which is my internal email address.

*Artifactory Server*
- https://github.ibm.com/Cloud-DevOps-Transformation-Services/artifactory-repositories/pull/1459[Onboarding Github Pull Request]
- https://na.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory[Primary Server]
- https://eu.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory[Secondary/replication Server]



*Docker registry*
From SK:
```
The address should be `[your repo name].artifactory.swg-devops.com/[your docker image name]`
For us, its `ip-rca-docker-local.artifactory.swg-devops.com/ibm/rca-service:latest`
```

From the confirmation email:
```
ip-q7-risk-rcoc-op-docker-local  [docker repo @ ip-q7-risk-rcoc-op-docker-local.artifactory.swg-devops.com]
```
