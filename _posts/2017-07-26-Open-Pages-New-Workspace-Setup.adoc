== Flowing with an RTC stream ==

- Navigate to Team Artifacts
- Create a new workspace by searching for the desired stream--in this example, 7.3.0.2
	* Right click _My Repository Workspaces_
    * Select _Search for Repository Workspaces..._
    * Narrow the search to find streams only
    * Enter 7.3.0.2 in the search terms. 
    * In this example, the search results find 7.3.0.2 (OpenPages 7.x Maintenance) 
    * Right click and selected _New â†’ Repository Workspace_. 
    * On the ensuing dialog, clicked the _Finish_ button at the bottom and the workspace loads after a long delay (I think I had to choose the projects, and I chose them all).

== Fixing compilation errors after the workspace is loaded ==

Error 1 - Target runtime Apache Tomcat v8.0 is not defined.	com.ibm.openpages.apps

== Plugin Problems ==

*Issues with IBPM Studio and codegenerator*

- Close projects
	* /com.openpages.integration.ibpm.studio
    * /com.ibm.rave.openpages.codegenerator
    
== Compilation Errors ==

With so many projects in Eclipse that we don't use for OpenPages web development, it is OK to close some of the projects that we don't actively use.  Which are safe to close is not easy to determine, so I close a bunch and hope for the best.

I am closing:

- opsearchtool
- /com.ibm.openpages.reporting.commandcenterinstallercustomcode
- /com.ibm.openpages.env.comparison.tests

== Change to Hierarchy View of Working Sets ==

- In upper right hand corner of Project Explorer, click on down arrow glyph
- Change _Projects Presentation_ to _Hierarchical_
_ Change _Top Level Elements_ to _Working Sets_
_ Click on _Select Working Set_, then _Select All_, then _OK_
