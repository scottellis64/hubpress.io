= OpenPages New Workspace Setup
:hp-tags: setup, openpages, dev

== Flowing with an RTC stream ==

- Navigate to Team Artifacts
- Create a new workspace by searching for the desired stream--in this example, 7.3.0.2
	* Right click _My Repository Workspaces_
    * Select _Search for Repository Workspaces..._
    * Narrow the search to find streams only
    * Enter 7.3.0.2 in the search terms. 
    * In this example, the search results find 7.3.0.2 (OpenPages 7.x Maintenance) 
    * Right click and selected _New â†’ Repository Workspace_. 
    * On the ensuing dialog, clicked the _Finish_ button at the bottom and the workspace loads after a long delay (I think I had to choose the projects, and I chose them all.
