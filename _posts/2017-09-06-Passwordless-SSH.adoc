= Passwordless SSH
:hp-tags: bash_tips

todo: instructions here for setting up passwordless ssh to remote systems

*Problem: After setting up ssh, being prompted to enter passphrase*

See if ~/.ssh/id_rsa is encrypted:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | head -2

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
```

The output above shows that the file is encrypted.  The solution is to first back the original file up then create a decrypted version of it:

```
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa.bak
openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out ~/.ssh/id_rsa.decrypted
mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa.decrypted ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
