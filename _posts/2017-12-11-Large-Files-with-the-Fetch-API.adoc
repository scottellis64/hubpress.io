= Large Files with the Fetch API 
:hp-tags: research

FileSaver.js, I have discovered, has a file size restriction of around 500m, which is on the edge for our product.  The limitation is due to the Blob construct, which is browser-specific.  

Looking into replacements, it seems that the Fetch API could be the answer, but it is not supported by IE11.  But, with a polyfill it might just work.
