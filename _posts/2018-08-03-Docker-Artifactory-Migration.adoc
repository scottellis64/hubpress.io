= Docker Artifactory Migration

Started work https://github.ibm.com/OpenPages/backlog/issues/512#issuecomment-7160506[here]

```
docker login --username _user email_ http://ip-op-grc-docker-local.artifactory.swg-devops.com
```

Password is the Artifactory API key generated https://na.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory/webapp/#/profile[here]
For user email, you can use your own email address provided that you are a member of the admin https://w3-03.ibm.com/tools/groups/protect/groupsgui.wss[bluegroup].

Created a bash script called push.sh in folder ~projects/ibm/op-mainline/devops/docker that tags and pushes a local docker image to the new remote Artifactory docker registry.  The script has this content:

```bash
docker tag $1 ip-op-grc-docker-local.artifactory.swg-devops.com/op/$2:8.0.0.1-249
docker push ip-op-grc-docker-local.artifactory.swg-devops.com/op/$2:8.0.0.1-249
```

$1 is the container id of the docker image, which can be identified by typing: 
```
docker ps -a

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                           COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES

```

$2 is the image/repository name, such as opapp_db2 or opapp_oracle.  A complete listing can be found http://masa-rhel11.swg.usma.ibm.com/repositories[here].
