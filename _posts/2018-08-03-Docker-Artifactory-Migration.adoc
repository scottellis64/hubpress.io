= Docker Artifactory Migration

Started work https://github.ibm.com/OpenPages/backlog/issues/512#issuecomment-7160506[here]

```
docker login --username _user email_ https://ip-op-grc-docker-local.artifactory.swg-devops.com
```

Password is the Artifactory API key generated https://na.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory/webapp/#/profile[here]
For user email, you can use your own email address provided that you are a member of the admin https://w3-03.ibm.com/tools/groups/protect/groupsgui.wss[bluegroup].  When doing this for the automated build, its probably best to use the api key for opdevops@us.ibm.com.  

Created a bash script called push.sh in folder ~/projects/ibm/devops/grc-devops/docker that tags and pushes a local docker image to the new remote Artifactory docker registry.  The script has this content:

```bash
docker tag $1 ip-op-grc-docker-local.artifactory.swg-devops.com/op/$2:8.0.0.1-249
docker push ip-op-grc-docker-local.artifactory.swg-devops.com/op/$2:8.0.0.1-249
```

$1 is the container id of the docker image, which can be identified by typing: 
```
docker ps -a

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                           COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
2c7d4485ee94        docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss:6.1.0   "/entrypoint-artifacâ€¦"   44 hours ago        Up 44 hours         0.0.0.0:80->8081/tcp   artifactory
```

$2 is the image/repository name, such as opapp_db2 or opapp_oracle.  A complete listing can be found http://masa-rhel11.swg.usma.ibm.com/repositories[here].

The manual method of migrating from our existing docker repository is to pull all the images locally, then tag and push to the Artifactory repository.  There doesn't appear to be an automatic way of doing this other than to write a script for it.  The push.sh script I wrote is for convenience and assumes the tag name, which of course could be parameterized as well.
