- I've managed to split my time with Algo finally, and have put a good days effort into the Reports page and have reports downloading on all browsers now.  It's in review right now.
- Started a Docker image for OP Installer testing, but found out it needs more than just Node.js installed on it
	* Go https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W1662f310fa3e_4801_b067_6cd1a876162b/page/Docker%20image%20dependency[here] for a view of the docker image dependencies to be installed on this system
- Been battling perception again, which appears to mostly be coming from Sandy
	* Ask Isaac about this in one-on-one today
    * Managed to get the UCF task resolved that was of most concern (https://ccm-risk.ottawa.ibm.com:9453/ccm/web/projects/OpenPages%20(Change%20Management)#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=67440[67440])
    * Knocked out https://ccm-risk.ottawa.ibm.com:9453/ccm/web/projects/OpenPages%20(Change%20Management)#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=64190[64190], the dashboard issue where the panel follows the mouse after clicking the Add New button.  Code was commented out that resolved the issue and I must have commented it out for testing and forgot to uncomment before checking in
    * Still working on https://ccm-risk.ottawa.ibm.com:9453/ccm/web/projects/OpenPages%20(Change%20Management)#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=60516[60516], the timesheet helper issue where it doesn't work if _openpages_ is taken out of the URL.  Code I changed isn't showing up and right now I think it's a build process issue.
    
*Going Forward*

- Working on Algo tasks until next Thursday
- RTC tasks for OP Installer tracking

*Typescript Conversion*

Should have understood existing process
They pick apart their source and deploy some of it remote
Wenlong told me that the receiveAssets endpoint was not important
I trusted Josh and Wenlong but I should have been deeper inside their thought processes
Wenlong doesn't work long hours and the effort wasn't there.
I should have been more aggresive but I trusted too much.
Didn't realize until too late that nothing had really been done on their end.
