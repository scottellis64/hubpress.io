<ul>
<li>
<p>Met yesterday with Isaac to discuss my PBC Goals, which I have updated.  I spent my lunch doing the updates and feel that I&#8217;ve done a decent job of it, but of course there are always going to be things I leave out.  I need to get better about writing down my accomplishments and activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We talked about Band 9 promotion again, but I felt like we have already been down this road before and there appears to still be a residual problem with unnamed members of my OpenPages community, to the point that it is probably time for me to seek out other opportunities within IBM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isaac told me that he achieved Band 9 by doing something outside of his normal workday by helping the services organization with some helper applications that made their lives easier. He advises me to do something similar, going outside of my assigned job to make a difference to the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I reminded him that I did the VM and made it so anyone that needed to could get a fresh development environment in a matter of hours instead of days or weeks. He acknowleged this and really considered it, but my concern is that I need to keep reminding him and anyone else that will listen that I did this.  He agrees that my push in this area propelled the installation team to pursue UCD and Docker, and now today an environment is a few clicks away.  But in general, it feels to me that my contribution here is forgotten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isaac implied that I might not like it if I were to achieve Band 9, and talked about the Peter Principle.  I told him that I was already working at the Band 9 level where I came from, and that I was told that I would get there in few years once I came on board.  It turns out that John started at Band 9, and I&#8217;m kicking myself because I should have made it a condition of my coming into IBM, but I didn&#8217;t know how it works.  I told Isaac that I am ready and have all the confidence in the world in my ability to succeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He described the process of how the team meets to discuss who should be in line for promotions.  He told me that Bob no longer rolls his eyes when Isaac tells him what I am working on, so Bob is an impediment to my succession.  He is one but I don&#8217;t know who else.  I need to ask who specifically is blocking me.  He told me that John is someone who would have an influence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isaac told me that there are limited Band 9 spots, and IBM will give the ok to grant them on a limited basis.  Siva was just promoted to Band 9, so another opportunity has come and gone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I expressed my dissatisfaction with working on OpenPages defects, that I really enjoyed the creative liberties working on the Installer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do I imagine will be the benefit of Band 9, he asked.  He was thinking it was a money thing.  My answer, job satisfaction.  The work I&#8217;m doing now can be done by anyone&#8212;&#8203;my talents are being wasted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I said that I won&#8217;t be here in a year if this continues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He said I should do some presentations.  This has been said before when we discussed this when Isaac first took over as manager.  He had also talked about inviting me to some architect meetings with Masa and John.  Never happened.  Seems like all the things we talked about pertaining to Band 9 promotion has been completely forgotten.  The last one-on-one when I mentioned it, he told me that all the action items are mine, but the prior one-on-one he told me that he will look into it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wrapped up by saying that I need to be given opportunity to work with the larger organization in order to achieve outside influence.  I did well with the Installer team, but Isaac sort of implied that nobody respects the installation team in any organization, so any contributions there would not be respected.  I asserted that I needed opportunities to shine, but working on OpenPages defects is not it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I noticed that the work on the next version of OpenPages UI is being done by everyone around me.  On Friday last week, the group of Mike, Kate, John and Isaac talked about it outside of my cubicle and they were excited working together and strategizing.  Isaac stopped by afterward, I think because he obviously knew I had heard them talking, and told me that they are pulling Jianbo into the group, and that I would keep working on defects for a while.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m clearly not part of anything and am being relegated onto side avenues while the core group creates and plans.</p>
</div>]]></description><link>https://scottellis64.github.io/2017/11/21/Info.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://scottellis64.github.io/2017/11/21/Info.html</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Ellis]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building op-app.ear with using Gradle]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph">
<p>My newest assignment is to figure out how to build OpenPages using Gradle for the purpose of integrating added applications to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>todo: make a graph of the applications we have today and show how the gradle build is going to work</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Inception</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When this suggested to me, I wasn&#8217;t thrilled about it.  But as I considered it closely, this is an opportunity to remove OpenPages from Eclipse once and for all.  The problem here is that Eclipse is the tool we use to create the build artifacts, and as such is tightly intertwined with our build and release processes.  Making any change to the project structure has implications that would create too much risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being in Eclipse, there is no tooling that creates a visualization of the workspace&#8217;s dependency structure, and so you are forced to investigate manually.  Using Gradle or Maven, such visualizations are available, and these are much easier to follow and understand.  And, best of all, these can be easily extended for purposes such as my current task.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started doing some of this manually.  Here to the best of my recollection are the steps I&#8217;ve followed so far:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Created an IntelliJ Gradle project in ~/projects/ibm/op-7.4-idea</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opened Eclipse to the current OpenPages 7.4 project that was already on my system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now I found the rootmost project in the Eclipse workspace, which appears to be called <strong>modelobjects</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tbd</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea is, look into an api that gives insight on an Eclipse workspace that can be read and translated into something else, in my case Gradle.  The process of doing it manually is cumbersome, and the process will need to be repeated for every build, as projects are updated constantly.  So the workflow will look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1) Gradle script uses RTC command line to pull the latest code
2) Gradle script builds the application, perhaps with addons specified
3) Out pops op-apps.ear</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>So, investigating an API to provide Eclipse introspection, and failing that or maybe instead of that, read the eclipse project files in code I&#8217;ve written based upon what I&#8217;m seeing in the OpenPages project in Eclipse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigating RTC command line</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Man, this might be easy</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So as I look at the .classpath of each project, its a simple XML structure.  Here&#8217;s an example for the project <strong>aurora</strong>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

<li>
<p>Had an issue after the automatic reboot that there was no ip address assigned and the setup failed to continue.  Rebooted manually and the ip address came back, and luckily the same one as before.  Had to rerun the install and now am waiting for reboot to see if the same thing happens.  If it does I will try to reboot it myself before the UCD process resumes and encounters the same error again.  Before it failed because of the ip problem, but I&#8217;m figuring that I can reboot while it is waiting three minutes to resume.  But this time after reboot the ip address is still assigned, so I&#8217;m thinking it will proceed this time to the finish.</p>

<p>Enabling ES6 syntax in node applications is necessary only until it is supported natively by Node itself.  For now, es6-enabled javascript code needs to be transpiled into es5 syntax.  The most popular transpiler for this purpose is Babel.  There are others, and I haven&#8217;t tried them.  There has been no need.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the root of your project, install some dependencies that will be saved to your project&#8217;s project.json:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many options for Babel that can be configured.  In a server-side project, the only transpilations we need are for NodeJS code, nothing for the multititude of browsers that exist in the world.  So in package.json, this config block will restrict itself to transpilations for the currently targeted node version:</p>

<p>Offered advice to Wenlong about how to handle long running requests:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>out for part of the afternoon</strong>
12:23 PM

Wenlong,</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll be working at home in the afternoon, so I think we will miss one another.  We can meet online and have a discussion on Zoom when you have the time, any time between 1 and 2:30.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically what is happening is that all your file io operations are being done synchronously, and that causes the node server to hold onto the processor, which blocks other requests from being given control.  Node works on what they call an event loop, and whenever you perform an asynchronous operation you are giving up your hold on the event loop, which would then give the green light to other processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will run out of time to provide this for you today, but I wanted to try using a library called fs-extra-promise.  Its kind of like fs-extra in that it adds methods to fs, but it creates a set of methods that return promises instead of using the callback mechanism, appending the suffix "Async" to all the non-synch methods.  For example, this code in pre-vali-action.js in runPreValidation:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>if(fs.existsSync(serverInfoJsonFile)){
    fs.removeSync(serverInfoJsonFile);
}
becomes something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>fs.existsAsync(serverInfoJsonFile)
    .then((exists) &#8658; {
        if (! exists) {
            fs.removeAsync(serverInfoJsonFile)
                .then(() &#8658; {
                    // continue
                })
        } else {
            // continue
        }
    });
}
But this creates challenges from a coding standpoint.  You have two places above that lead to the same logical branch, where it is commented to continue.  So, you will have to restructure the code in places.  Here, you would be best served to create a function that returns a Promise as such:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>function removeFileIfExists(fileName) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) &#8658; {
        fs.existsAsync(serverInfoJsonFile)
            .then((exists) &#8658; {
                if (! exists) {
                    fs.removeAsync(serverInfoJsonFile)
                        .then(() &#8658; {
                            resolve();
                        })
                } else {
                    resolve();
                }
            });
    });
}
and calling this function looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>removeFileIfExists(serverInfoJsonFile).then(() &#8658; {
    var args;</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>// Database server
// TODO: Remove the next line when DB2 validation is ready
if (db.db_type == constants.dbtype_oracle){</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So there will be some refactoring involved with this strategy, but I don&#8217;t think you can avoid it since synchronous IO is done so often.  Here is a link to an article describing the problem you will encounter with blocking calls like most of the file io calls that are being employed: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/" class="bare">https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A combination of promises and asynchronous file io will fix the issue you are having, but it will take some doing.  Nothing to get worried about, but it will be a hot topic and should be brought up in todays meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alternative strategy would be to spawn child processes to do the work, but that would involve similar refactoring activities.  My vote would be to unblock the event loop with asynchronous file io calls.</p>

<p><strong>Promises in the op-installer server</strong>
Yesterday, 12:30 PM
me to Wenlong Jiang
Show more
Wenlong,</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s meet later this afternoon&#8212;&#8203;I have a 3PM meeting that will be about a half hour.  I can see where the promise method can be implemented for testing/poc in your code.  The basic pattern will work like this, but I haven&#8217;t tried it yet in this specific instance:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In install-config-routes.js, you would return a new promise from the /installConfig route.  It looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>return new Promise((resolve, reject) &#8658; {</p>
</div>
<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i">
<li>
<p>all your existing code</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>});</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This returns right away but does not send anything back to the browser since nothing has been piped to the response.  So the browser at this point is just waiting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ve essentially released the other endpoints to respond to other requests by return the promise, and simultaneously the code within the promise is being executed in a virtual thread.  There are no real threads in javascript, but it&#8217;s treated like one by the interpreter so for all intents and purposes this is now a thread.  Your code can still handle responses the way it does now, as with this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>return response.status(500).send(util.format(messages.deployment_folder_not_exist, deploymentName));</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>but instead of returning right away, you would call the resolve method defined in the promise callback: resolve()&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which releases the promise from being processed.  If any error occurs, you can reject the promise in the same fashion: reject();</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the auth-server, resolving and rejecting cause something to be propagated to the response by the typescript-rest library, but here we are only releasing the promise and handling the response ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the bottom of your method, you are calling configManager.runConfigActions, followed by configManager.waitCompConfigToFinish.  You can instead have configManager.runConfigActions return a promise just as this route has done.  The call will look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>configManager.runConfigActions(&#8230;&#8203;)
   .then((data) &#8658; {
      // set the data into the response you need then resolve the promise
      resolve();
   })
   .catch((err) &#8658; {
      // emit error and reject
      reject();
   });</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No need to call waitCompConfigToFinish.  Change runConfigActions to return a promise and keep working until the actions are complete, then resolve, which triggers your routes then handler, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I can help you with this later, but take a look to see if you can make sense of it.  You can see an example of all this in action in auth-server &#8594; AuthorizationService.ts.  The login request returns a promise&#8212;&#8203;it&#8217;s typescript so there are some syntactical differences, such as returning a promise with a type defined (Promise&lt;AuthToken&gt;), but the concept is the same; it&#8217;s just a Promise instance.  The method returns a new promise right away, then calls an asynchronous method UserModel.findUser().  You can see how not finding a user triggers a Promise rejection, and also you&#8217;ll see how I&#8217;m calling multiple asynchronous methods and resolving the original request only when I&#8217;ve completely processed multiple asynchronous operations.  This end point is a typescript-rest endpoint, so I&#8217;m able to reject with errors and those errors put into the http response for me, so that part is different, but I think you can see how this works from this example.</p>

<p>Wenlong needs help with long running tasks kicked off by Rest API requests.
The problem now is that processing these requests keeps a grib on the event loop with blocking IO (file IO using the sync versions) such that control of the event loop is not relinquished.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve introduced Promises, and that, along with the use of the aysnchronous versions of the file IO calls may do the trick, since using the asynchronous calls may give up the event loop and allow processing of a simultaneous request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If that is not enough, then there is an interesting [library](<a href="https://github.com/soyuka/relieve" class="bare">https://github.com/soyuka/relieve</a>) called Relieve available on NPM that spawns the handling of a task using Promises.</p>

<pre>Its all about the docker image.
Learned about working IBM GitHub and creating issues and resolving.
I'm working on setting up Tomcat 7 on Centos 7 with ssl enabled and Java 8
Had some trouble with all this since Docker is not something I know through and through

<pre>.Todos
* Prioritize getting stories and tasks created and estimated
  - Get acceptance criteria done and make sure QE has enough to create test plans
* Rename UCF Connector tab to UCF Connector / RCoC Q1
* Modify team members:
  - Remove Ken as build engineer
  - Add Mark as QE
* Add one or two sprints to the project
* Identify one or two stories to get started on before leaving for Christmas break
* Questionnaire is a nice-to-have; prioritize UCF Connector
* Get UCF connector story/task into implementing state
* Review stories 52328, 52308 and 52309 to see if they can be finished off after the new REST TDI connector is implemented
* Consider adding a task for converting existing file connector-implemented stories/tasks to using the new REST TDI connector
* Update scheme task or story??

.Kick off
* Scrum kick off meeting is set for Thursday at 4
* Talk about which stories to work on
* Schedule stand up for two times a week and pick a day and time that works for everyone

NOTE: UCF will likely merge into the larger RCoC team

.Chris' suggestions for working with RCoC group (Rajeev and ?)
* Do quality work--there are high expectations of me coming in
* Communicate effectively and often--don't let problems queue up without letting folks know what is going on
* Rajeev is easy going, but members are emotionally vested in their product (implication is, choose my words carefully, be diplomatic)
* Provide very good input
* Keep promises
* Sift into the mix gradually
* Don't overstretch

.Random notes from one on one meeting
* There will be one week left after vacation for sprint 2
* In betwixt all this, I need to be ready to help out if needed with OpenPages, either to offer guidance or to jump in and make fixes</pre>

<p>I presented my design to the OpenPages UI team today&#8212;&#8203;I put quite a bit of work into it.  I had prepared several UML class diagrams detailing the entity relationships, and prepared xsd schemas to describe the format of the dojo data stores.  Some of the diagrams had a lot of content, so I was nervous about showing the first of them.  When I did, Chris had a look on his face and stopped me to ask why it was so complicated, and went on to say that when he looks at diagrams like that, he doesn&#8217;t understand them at all.  He prefers code snippets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So this is interesting.  Complicated&#8212;&#8203;this has been the most enduring criticism of my code and designs since I started at IBM, tracing back to my first feature, the Actor Picker, when Mike Poole thought that the solution I came up with was way over the top.  Mike has gone out of his way to point out that he thinks that John Owen is a superstar and that he and I were just ok.  I&#8217;m not sure where he stands on that today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But now here is Chris parroting those same words.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In listening to the session playback later (I&#8217;m backwriting this post on December 7), I&#8217;m disappointed by the number of times I say "uh".  I need to be better prepared.  However, I am not prepared because I was busy and barely finished preparing my design diagrams and slides.  I have to be better at presenting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>John Owen asks me a question in the meeting and says essentially that we should have pushed back and took away from the complexity of what was delivered by only having a single wiget per panel.  This is irritating because everyone involved knew about the design and there was plenty of time to push back then.  Now I have to listen to this while presenting what I consider to be incredibly good work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keep in mind that this feature is now delivered.  Yes, it went right up to the buzzer but it is done and is working extremely well.  And by its very nature the feature is complex and it was an accomplishment to get this done and have it be as solid as it is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I can&#8217;t help but think that my success in this is causing John and maybe even Chris some discomfort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In regards to the complexity of diagrams, here are some things that were said:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Chris: I can&#8217;t read this</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>John: The json is probably a much more consise view of the same information</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Kate: No, but Chris, I like jumped right in and added features to this.  This is making it seem more complicated than it is</code></p>
